Dirt, sludge and limescale buildup over time can reduce the efficiency of your central heating system and effectively raise your heating bills. Dublin Plumbing Services suggests that if this occurs, rather than replacing your entire heating system with an expensive new model, you hire our skilled engineers for a power flush at an affordable price. Power flushing your central heating system will restore its circulation and improve its energy efficiency, which will in turn lower your heating bills. Our engineers are qualified to power flush any central heating system make or model, whether it be gas or oil. The process is simple and non-invasive, and it rarely takes our engineers more than a day. If you are in need of a power flush, our engineers will first drain your central heating system. Then, they will flush the system with a chemical cleaning solution and replenish it with clean water. When the process is complete, your system will be free of any unwanted materials and in its best working condition.
